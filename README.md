inari is the installer, profiles, and extras on top of [EllesmereUI](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/ellesmereui). It imports 16:9 and 21:9 layouts, player and target portraits, frame shadows, and the supporting profiles for BigWigs, EXBoss, sArena, and Baganator.

Setup and downloads live on **[inari.ink](https://inari.ink)**. This repo is the addon.

## Install

**1.0.5 is a full reinstall.** Delete the previous copy of this addon from `Interface\AddOns` and reimport the WowUp string. Settings do not carry over.

1. In [WowUp](https://wowup.io/), open **My Addons → Import** and paste the string from [inari.ink/install](https://inari.ink/install).
2. Restart World of Warcraft and log in. The installer opens, picks 16:9 or 21:9 from your monitor, and imports both layouts.

If it does not open:

```
/inari install
```

No WowUp? Grab [inari.zip](https://github.com/inariink/inari/releases/latest/download/inari.zip) or install from [CurseForge](https://inari.ink). Those are inari only — EllesmereUI and the rest still have to be installed separately. A [video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4Ub_4-39Xk) covers the full setup.

## What it does

- **Layouts** — Bundled EllesmereUI profiles for 16:9 and 21:9. The installer imports both; switch later with `/inari layout 16` or `/inari layout 21`.
- **Portraits** — Player and target portraits are built in. Blinkii's Portraits is not required.
- **Appearance** — Dark or class coloring, health opacity, class-background tint, chat button side, and drop shadows on unit frames, resource bars, and the cooldown manager.
- **Profiles** — Imports for BigWigs (including boss options and an inari countdown voice), EXBoss, sArena Reloaded, Baganator, and Cooldown Manager.
- **Healing** — A healing profile that activates on healer specs.

Required: **EllesmereUI** and **inari**. Optional, but what the installer styles: BigWigs / LittleWigs, EXBoss, sArena Reloaded, Baganator.
